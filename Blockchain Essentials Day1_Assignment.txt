 Question 1. 
 --->	A Blockchain is a constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place, in a secure, chronological and 
	immutable way in decentralized distributed network. 

 Question 2.
 --->	International Banking Crisis with the collapse of investment in 2008 was the actual problem due to which blockchain has appeared. Blockchain is a kind of 
        phylosophy, i.e. doing practice we can avoid hacking, increase our security, we can eliminate the third party in between our transactions, also we can do 
	lot od decentralization.

 Question 3.
 --->	Features of Blockchain
	1> Cannot be corrupted
	2> Decentralized technology
	3> Enhanced security
	4> Consensus
	5> Distributed ledgers
	6> Faster settlement

 Question 4.
 --->	Block contains
	1> Block number
	2> Transaction records
	3> Previous block signature
	4> Mining key etc.

 Question 5.
 --->   Blockchain is a mix of two technologies i.e. Distributed database(Making the copy of same document different places) and Cryptography(Converting some text 
    	into a fingerprint). Distributed database started in the late 1970s and cryptography was found in around 1900 BC in Egypt.
	    E.g. - Let's consider we have a distributed system different machines are at different places and we have a copy of data with us having its own key i.e. 
		   fingerprint.Every 10 mins the data keeps on updating. Such huge amount of data can't be checked line by line by each and everyone every time. But, 
		   we can check the current fingerprint. And this key can be shared on one common platform where all can check their keys are matching/ same or not. 
	           If someone is working with wrong key then other people in the community can raise the issue that, "hey, you are holding the wrong key, Please update 
		   with new one that all are working with." 
 	In this way, the varifiability in blockchain can be achieved.
